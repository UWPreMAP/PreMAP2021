You need both $d$ and $D$ to be given in the same units. Here we will use centimeters. <br>\n",

Doc-strings are REALLY important when working on a long term research project. You will likely need to go back to code you write a couple of weeks/months/years ago and you need to understand what it does. In addition to adding doc-strings, make sure you comment your code. I always add comments with units for constants, because this can help clarify bugs later on!
