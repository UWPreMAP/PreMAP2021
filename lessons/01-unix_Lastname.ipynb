    "Very general question time: What is it that computers *do*? Computers can interact with us, store information for us, run programs, etc. Computers can help us do science! We, as scientists, interact with computers in a couple of basic ways, through the **command line interface (CLI)** or a **graphical user interface (GUI)**. What are some examples of GUIs? Well, almost everything you're used to using is a GUI! Word, Excel, etc. GUIs are great because they require no memorization of syntax or knowledge of programming--you can simply use menus and icons to move, delete, or open a file. So why bother with CLI at all? Because it can be very convenient and powerful, and we will learn how! \n",

    "**COMMAND SHELL**: The command shell is a program that helps you communicate with your computer. You type a something into the terminal, and then the shell takes this and figures out what commands the computer needs to run and then orders the computer to do so. A commonly used shell for Unix is the Bash shell. Let's start off with some very basic shell commands. NOTE: Because I'm in this python notebook environment I need to include this first line with the percentage signs. It is called a magic function and it just helps me simulate being in the shell environment. You DO NOT need to use this.  "

    "There are even more Unix commands (not covered here) that are listed on the Unix Cheat Sheet that you have. This includes things like how to download a file from the internet (given a web address of the file), how to create a tarball, how to copy things between machines, etc. Now that we've gone over these basic commands today I'll show you one last thing, which is how to remotely log into your machines.

Once you have this file all set up (again ON your laptop), you should be able to remotely log into an astrolab computer with the following command (also on the Unix Cheat Sheet):"
