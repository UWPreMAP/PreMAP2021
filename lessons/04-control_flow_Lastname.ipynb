    "# Control flow\n",
    "### Control flow statements literally control the flow of your code!\n",
    "There are a few basic types of control flow statements that we will learn. These are as follows: \n",
    "- **if:** do something _if_ some condition is `True`\n",
    "- **for:** do something repeatedly _for_ some number of times, or on some number of items\n",
    "- **while:** do something _while_ some condition is `True`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples. **Notice that indentation (whitespace preceding code) matters in Python**! Blocks of text following a `for`, `while` or `if` statement must be indented to run properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When you need a program to do something more complicated than arithmetic, you'll sometimes need the code to do something _if_ some condition is met, otherwise it should do something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "One basic example is checking a password. _If_ someone submits the right password, then tell them they're welcome, _else_ (otherwise) give them a warning to get away. Here's how we can do that in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "password = 'friend'\n",
    "\n",
    "if password == 'friend':\n",
    "    # This indented code will only run if the above condition is True\n",
    "    print('Enter.')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # This indented code will only run if the above condition is False\n",
    "    print('You shall not pass!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Copy and paste this code into the cell below, and check that it works for various values of `password`."
