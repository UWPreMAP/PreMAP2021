Cosmology is the study of the origin and nature of the universe as a whole.
To study cosmology we "look back in time", by looking deep into space we can see light from the universe's past.
This is because light travels at a finite speed, so if we look at a part of the universe that is 1000 light-years away, we are looking 1000 years into the past because light from that region took 1000 years to reach us.
For cosmology we usually look billions of years into the past, the universe is approximately 13.77 billion years old.
