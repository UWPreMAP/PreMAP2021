Galaxies are an incredibly large collection of stars that are gravitationally bound to each other.
Some galaxies have super-massive black holes near their centers.
There are many different types of galaxies but the two primary types are spiral and elliptical galaxies.
There are many different regions in a galaxy, for example in a spiral galaxy the arms are a region that contain young stars.
