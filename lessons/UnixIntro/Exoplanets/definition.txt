Exoplanets are what we call planets that are outside of our solar system.
Long considered likely to exist, exoplanets were first experimentally verified (observed) in the 1990s.
By studying exoplanets, we can learn more about the planets in our own solar system, we can also attempt to look for life outside of our solar system.
There are many different kinds of exoplanets: Hot Jupiters are giant gas planets that are very close to their host star, while Super-Earths are planets that seem like they might be rocky (like Earth, Venus, or Mars) but are bigger and more massive than Earth.
